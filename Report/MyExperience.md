## World Navigator Project, Lessons and Experences.. 

### What can i say?
1. Over engineering is devil,  you have to keep in mind that Simple is always better .. sometimes the best design is to get it done.!

2.  "Best design is to get it done" ? , on the other hand .. if you build a good design and discussed all the situations if possible, you will see great results .. 

3. Don't overthink the future.. if their is a part in your project that you didn't know how you are going to deal with or to solve.. Just start doing it.. sometimes you will see that those parts are easiest that the rest of your project!

### Q&A

# How many designs did you build until you choose the last one?
 - Well , i can say (3)..  I really spend all the time exploring how to design and reading and watching are related useful resources .. but sometimes you just need to start going in details  so you can fill these gaps in your voisin .. 
-> One of the designs that i had built  included  the following :
Wall with 2 sides .. 
Wall can be in two rooms , each one of them on a side.
Wall can have many items in many directions .. you have to specify where to look ..
Items? items just need to implement **Lookable** interface which includes 
look();
runCommand(Command command);

but, while reading a game design book, they said the in game development .. its better always to separate everything ,even if it's not possible in reality (2 rooms connected by outside reference ). So i decided to change everything after taking that on consideration ..
